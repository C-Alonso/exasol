# Exasol

This repository contains two Python files. The code demonstrates the implementation of a conciliation service.

## Files

### 1. `conciliation_base.py`
This file defines the `ConciliationServiceBase` class, which provides the foundational logic for generating conciliation reports.

### 2. `conciliation_service_exasol.py`
This file defines the `ExasolConciliationService` class, which extends the functionality of `ConciliationServiceBase` to include specific features for Exasol.

## Notes
- There are more than 400 lines of code, however, many of them are due to NotImplementedError implementations.
- The lines of code that are commented out are just there to show how the correctness of the result was verified.
- These files are shared exclusively for review purposes with Exasol.
